            <h2>A little introduction.</h2>
            <p>Also known as Fushigi Yûgi Gaiden, there are a total of eleven novels (although finally there are
                thirteen
                books, since two of them are doubles) that have stories written by <em>Nishizaki Megumi.</em></p>

            <p>Most of the novels, specifically nine, correspond to stories focused on certain characters, to delve into
                them more than the manga does.</p>

                before himself to his strength and in the face of such determination, he has no choice but to accept it,
