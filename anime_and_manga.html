            <h2>Manga</h2>
            <img src="PHOTOS/Manga.jpg" width="250" height="350" alt="Manga_image">
            <p>Written and illustrated by <strong>Yuu Watase</strong>, <em>Fushigi Yûgi</em> originally appeared in
                serial form in the semimonthly
                manga magazine <strong>Shōjo Comic</strong>. It premiered in the January 1, 1992 (No. 1) issue, released
                in December
                1991, and ran for over five years, ending in the June 5, 1996 (No. 12) issue, released in May
                1996. The series was simultaneously published in eighteen collected volumes by Shogakukan, with new
                volumes being released on a quarterly schedule.</p>

            <p>In 1992, <strong>Viz Media</strong> licensed the manga for an English-language release in North America.
                The series was
                originally released in a flipped trade paperback format, starting in August 1998. Several characters
                have both Japanese pronunciations and Chinese pronunciations. In 1998, Watase visited the United States
                and
                met with Viz staff members at their San Francisco headquarters. Viz kept the original Chinese names of
                characters at her request. <em>Bill Flanagan</em>, the editor of the English version, asked Watase if he
                should use
                the Chinese names for popular characters such as Tai Yi-Jun (Taitsukun), and she also asked for the
                Chinese
                names to be used there. The characters with names remaining in Japanese in the English version are the
                characters such as Tamahome who have Japanese pronunciations of ancient constellations; there was never
                any
                intention of them having Chinese names.</p>

            <p>This caused some confusion for fans as the anime version uses the Japanese names. For example, in the
                manga,
                Hotohori's country is named "Hong-Nan" rather than the "Konan" found in the anime series. After eight
                volumes, Viz stopped publication of Fushigi Yûgi, reviving it in June 2003 when it released the first
                two
                volumes in unflipped standard manga size volumes. The remaining volumes were released on a quarterly
                schedule, including the remaining ten volumes. The final volume of the series was released in April
                2006.
                The dates and ISBN numbers given for the first eight volumes in the table on the link above are for the
                second edition releases.</p>

            <p>Viz also serialized Fushigi Yûgi in their manga anthology magazine, <strong>Animerica Extra</strong>,
                starting with the
                October 1998 debut issue and running until the December 2004 issue, the magazine's final issue. In 2009
                and 2010, Viz re-released the series as part of their "VIZBIG" line, combining three individual volumes
                of
                the original release into each single, larger volume.</p>

            <h2>Anime</h2>
            <img src="PHOTOS/Anime.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Anime_image">
            <p>Produced by <strong>Studio Pierrot</strong>, the fifty-two episode Fushigi Yûgi anime series premiered on
                TV Tokyo on April
                6, 1995. The series aired weekly, until the final episode that was aired on March 28, 1996. The series
                was licensed for English-language release to Region 1 DVD and VHS format by <strong>Geneon
                    Entertainment</strong>, then named
                <strong>Pioneer</strong>, under the expanded title Fushigi Yûgi: The Mysterious Play. It has been
                suggested that
                Geneon chose to license the series based on its popularity among the fansub community. The main series
                was released in eight individual volumes and as two box sets, the Suzaku and Seiryū sets. Media Blasters
                license-rescued the series, and released the first season to DVD on June 19, 2012. Season 2 was released
                on February 12, 2013.

            <h2>Differences between anime and manga</h2>
            <p>The most tangible differences between the manga and the anime are the beginning (in writing, Miaka
                escapes
                from her family situation and on the screen she goes to visit the library) and in the return to reality,
                in
                the manga they both return (Miaka and Yui), while in the anime only Yui does. Yui in the tankoubon does
                not
                know that Miaka is in the book, while on television she does, experiencing pain in her leg like her
                friend
                or getting her uniform wet while she reads; there are facts that are not even named in the anime, but
                they
                are well documented in the manga.</p>

            <p>The ending is also different in the manga (the ending in volume 13, the other 5 correspond to the eggs)
                than
                in the anime.</p>
