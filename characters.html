            <p>
                Tamahome (鬼宿), real name Kishuku Sou (琮 鬼宿 Sō Kishuku, or Cóng Guǐxiù), is the first Suzaku warrior
                Miaka
                meets and has the character "Ogre" on his forehead. He appears to be obsessed with money, but only wants
                to use it to support his family. Tamahome is a very single-minded individual for the most part. At first
                his drive is his family - they are all encompassing to his attitude to life and everything he does is
                for their benefit, even to the point of making himself appear something of a penny pincher to a confused
                Miaka and company to begin with. Despite his altruistic reasons for needing money, Tamahome is also very
                proud and he doesn't ever divulge why he needs the money or even tells Miaka and the others about his
                family at all.

                He allows for no emotional distraction nor wasted action. Once someone's usefulness is exhausted, the
                person is eliminated. On the other hand, he has an undeniable charisma which allows him to skillfully
                manipulate people. He is considered the strongest Seiryuu warrior.
